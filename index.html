            <h3 id="top-h3">May 11th 1918</h3>
            <p>Richard Feynman was born in Queens, New York. As a Child Feynman showed great talent in Science and
                Technology. Apart from excellent Grades in the
                corresponding subjects, he earned some pocket money with the repair of radios.</p>

            <h3>1935-1939</h3>
            <p>He studied physics at MIT as an undergraduate. The results of his bachelor-thesis are today known as
                Hellmann-Feynman-Theorem.</p>

            <h3>1939-1943</h3>
            <p>Feynman visited Princeton University and worked as an assistant of John Wheeler. In 1942 he wrote his PhD
                thesis about path integrals, which he developed after an idea of Nobel laureate Paul Dirac.</p>

            <h3>WW2</h3>
            <p>During the Second World War Feynman was part of the Manhattan-Project in Los Alamos and thus he
                contributed to the
                first Atomic Bomb. Other well-known contributors to the Manhattan-Project were Enrico Fermi, Viktor
                Weisskopf and Robert Oppenheimer. During this time he discovered his passion for playing the Bongo's and
                he got married to his first Wife Arline Greenbaum, which sadly died in 1945 after a Tuberculosis
                infection.</p>

            <h3>1946-1965</h3>
            <p>After WW2 Feynman would start his Career as one of the most inspiring and brilliant teachers of his time.
                Until 1951 he lectured at Cornell University, but after that
                he would teach at Caltech in Pasadena for the rest of his Life. In 1965 he was awarded with the Nobel
                prize, together with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger "for their fundamental work in quantum
                electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles."
            </p>

            <h3>1966-1988</h3>
            <p>Richard Phillips Feynman died on February 15th 1988, at the age of 69, as a result of a cancer diesease.
